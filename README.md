# Dimension Reduction with Principal Component Analysis

This repository contains code and explanations for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in R. PCA is a powerful technique for dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving most of its variability. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to implementing PCA in R, along with examples using a dataset on wine.

## Contents

- **Code Files**: 
  - `PCA.R`: R file containing code and explanations for PCA.
  - `wine.data.csv`: Dataset used for demonstration.
  - `PCA.pdf`: pdf file containing code and explanations for PCA.
    
- **README**: 
  - `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the repository and instructions for use.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

2. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your system.

3. Open `PCA.R` in RStudio.

4. Execute the code chunks sequentially to perform PCA on the wine dataset.

5. Follow the explanations provided within the R file to understand each step of the PCA process.

6. Modify the code and experiment with different datasets as needed for your projects.

## Dataset

The wine dataset used in this repository contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. It comprises 13 variables measured for each type of wine.
